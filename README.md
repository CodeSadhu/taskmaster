# Taskmaster - Task Manager built with Flutter & Appwrite

Taskmaster is a Flutter app that serves as a tasks management tool. The app is designed to explore the capabilities of Appwrite, a backend as a service (BaaS) platform. It leverages the power of Appwrite to securely store and synchronize tasks, providing a seamless offline and online experience for users.

<!-- ## Features

- User authentication: Users can sign up, log in, and securely authenticate themselves within the app.
- Task management: Add, edit, and delete tasks with ease. Mark tasks as completed or pending, and prioritize them using custom categories.
- Offline storage: The app utilizes HiveDB, a lightweight NoSQL database, to store tasks locally on the device. This ensures that users can access and modify tasks even when they are offline.
- Automatic synchronization: Whenever an internet connection is available, Taskmaster automatically syncs the local task data with the Appwrite backend, ensuring that tasks are always up to date.
- Real-time updates: Taskmaster leverages the real-time capabilities of Appwrite to provide instant updates to the task list across multiple devices.

2. Create a new project in the Appwrite dashboard.

3. Note down your Appwrite endpoint URL and project ID.

4. Create an API key for your project and copy it.

5. Open the Taskmaster project in your preferred code editor.

6. Locate the `lib/appwrite/appwrite_config.dart` file.

7. Replace the placeholder values with your Appwrite endpoint URL, project ID, and API key.

   ```dart
   const String appwriteEndpoint = 'YOUR_APPWRITE_ENDPOINT_URL';
   const String appwriteProjectId = 'YOUR_APPWRITE_PROJECT_ID';
   const String appwriteApiKey = 'YOUR_APPWRITE_API_KEY';
   ```

8. Save the file.
